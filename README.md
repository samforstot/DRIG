The Direct Replay Information Gatherer is a sports gatherer that displays the success of your favorite athletes. 
At this moment, the D.R.I.G. only looks at all NBA games between 2019 and 2022 (This Current Season). We hope to make 
the D.R.I.G. more extensive in the future the the reach of its data, but this is a good start. 

The aim is to see how well your favorite teams and players have performed in each stat, or for the general curiousity of all statisitcs. 
In the future, we hope to implement a wider range of choices accross multiple sports. 

***As this was our first time using a UI (.NET FRAMEWORK), we are still learning! You need to have the MSVC (Visual C++) in order to run the UI correctly.
